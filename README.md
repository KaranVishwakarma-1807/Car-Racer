# Car-Racer
 This is a simple 2-D car racing game I made while learning Pygame module. 
 
 In this game , the player controls a car and races against the computer. The computer's car is controlled by the game itself.
 <br>
 The game ends when the player car reaches the end of the track.
 <br>
 This game finishes when the player completes 10 levels, with each level increasing the speed of the computer car.

 Despite of being so simple, it is so complex to make a game like this. 
 <br>
 It requires a lot of knowledge about game development, programming, and desiging. 
 <br>
 Being honest I didn't made this all by myself. Even I used some tutorials, examples and Pygame modules from the internet to make this game.

 In this game I got to learn a lot of things like:
 <br>
 -How to make a car move
 <br>
 -What calculations are made/used to make a car move
 <br>
 -collisons
 <br>
 -masking
 <br>
 etc etc.....

 There are various versions of this game. I made this game in Python.
 <br>
 In every version I have tried to make it more complex and interesting.
 <br>
 And I'll try to imporve it as much as I can..

 I hope you enjoy this game.
 <br>
 Enjoy!!
