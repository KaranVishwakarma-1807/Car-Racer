# Car-Racer
 This is a simple 2-D car racing game I made while learning Pygame module. 
 
 In this game , the player controls a car and races against the computer. The computer's car is controlled by the game itself. The game ends when the player car reaches the end of the track.
 This game finishes when the player completes 10 levels, with each level increasing the speed of the computer car.

 Despite of being so simple, it is so complex to make a game like this. It requires a lot of knowledge about game development, programming, and desiging. 
 Being honest I didn't made this all by myself. Even I used some tutorials, examples and Pygame modules from the internet to make this game.

 In this game I got to learn a lot of things like:
 -How to make a car move
 -What calculations are made/used to make a car move
 -collisons
 -masking
 etc etc.....

 There are various versions of this game. I made this game in Python.
 In every version I have tried to make it more complex and interesting.
 And I'll try to imporve it as much as I can..

 I hope you enjoy this game.
 Enjoy!!
